# Processing pipeline

This folder contains all the code used to be able to reproduce the analysis used in the reformulation report. See below for details of each sub-folder and the steps needed to run the code.

1. `prototyping`: Contains scripts of analysis that we implemented in the process of this project but were not used in the final report.
2. `preprocessing`: Contains functions used to pre-process and transform the data into the correct format for the analysis.
3. `clustering`: Contains the code to produce the clusters used in the report.
4. `create_report_outputs`: Contains the code to reproduce the metrics table and produce the figures and report documents used in the final report.

To reproduce the analysis, follow the steps in the `clustering` and then `create_report_outputs` folders.
